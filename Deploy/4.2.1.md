# Update
Open your raspberry pi and become root. or run with sudo

Download the (raw) updated file to your webfolder where you installed the enecsys dashboard. In my case it would look like this
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlmaca/Enecsys_Dashboard/master/src/pages/page_current_single_converter.php
```
Now move the file to your webdirectory (where you installed the dashboard). If you installed it with default settings you can use enecsys_solar

```
sudo cp page_current_single_converter.php /var/www/html/enecsys_solar/pages/
```
That's it. You don't have to restart anything. Just nagivate to the Live status and see if you can see the alias when you select the inverter. Make sure that you have set a alias for the inverter.
