# Intro

Enecys went bankrupt in 2015 and a lot of users were left in the dark and lost monitoring of their PV data. This dashboard will give you all the info you need. 

If you have Enecsys Gen1 inverters, you are able to use this dashboard. It will give you an indication of your inverters, with long term history. Ad the same time it will
output the data to your pvoutput, which has a bit more detailed history overall. 

I have build-in long time history reports so the main tables will stay clean and users don't have to cleanup their data. 
The dashboard has been proven to run long time on RPI 2,3,4 and 5 since 2015.

The reason i choose for RPI as a platform and not a cloud setup, is so users don't have to rely on an online platform (again). You control your data. Also the costs are low.
